 <h1>Computer</h1>

 <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs various tasks based on a set of instructions, known as programs or software. Computers have become a vital part of modern life, used in homes, schools, businesses, and industries around the world. They come in different forms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. At the core of every computer is a central processing unit (CPU), which acts as the brain, executing commands and managing operations.

   Computers are used for a wide range of activities.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<div>
   <p>Hi! My name is Aman Yadav, and I’m currently a student with a passion for learning and creating new things. This website is the very first one I’ve made, and I’m excited to share it with the world. It marks the beginning of my journey into web development and digital creativity.

      As a student, I’m always curious and eager to pick up new skills. Building this site has been a fun and challenging experience, and I’ve learned a lot along the way—from writing code to designing a layout that reflects who I am. I believe this is just the start, and I’m looking forward to making even more projects in the future.
      
      Thanks for stopping by and checking out my work!
